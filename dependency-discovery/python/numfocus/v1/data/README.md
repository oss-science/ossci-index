Contais stuff we got from numfocus

- ___manual.list____ - list of "non-problematic" packages listed as "first-class python projects" at _numfocus_. Manually created
- ___non-standard-package.dependencies___ - packages whose dependencies in the git repo are in somewhat weird places
- ___problematic.packages.md___ - what the name says :-)
