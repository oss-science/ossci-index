___v1___ contains data + results from the "first round" of analyzing the numfocus projects.

First round means
- only python
 - only those "officially sponsored" (ie not "affiliated")
 - only those that we could analyze w/ our "naive" approach
    - "naive" approach = `pip download` + look at the MANIFEST file
